# Image Processing with OpenCV and Matplotlib
A basic project that demonstrates how to perform simple image processing tasks using OpenCV and Matplotlib. The code includes steps for reading an image file, converting it to a Numpy array, resizing the image, and converting it from RGB to grayscale.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
 Install the required packages with:
```bash
 pip install opencv-python matplotlib ```


## Features
• Reading an image file: Loads an image and converts it into a Numpy array for processing.
• Resizing the image: Adjusts the image dimensions.
• RGB to Grayscale conversion: Converts the image from color to grayscale.
